# MIS 421 Assignment 1: HTML and CSS

>A blank html and css file has been provided for you. Find a movie or TV series that you are a fan of and employ the following HTML features:
- [] H1 Element with an ID of 'Title'. This should be the title of the media you chose.
- [] Image element related to the media with and ID of 'CoverArt' (Cover art is good here)
- [] Heading 5 element with an ID of 'Rating'. This should be the rating from IMDB out of 10
- [] Iframe embeding a youtube video of a trailer of the media with an ID of 'Trailer'. This can be acquired by right clicking on the video, and copying the embed.
- [] Attribute linking to the IMDB page
- [] Copy and paste the summary text from IMDB into a Paragraph element with an ID of 'Summary'
- [] Unorded list of three to five actors. This unorder list element should have an ID of 'Actors'

It is best to take this little pieces at a time, step by step, as not to get confused by too many things at once. [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/default.asp) is an amazing resource, and has examples on everything above if you get stuck. 
>Feel free to get creative and add additional features after base requirements have been met
