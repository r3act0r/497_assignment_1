# MIS 421 Assignment 1: HTML and CSS

A blank html file has been provided for you. Find a movie or TV series that you are a fan of and employ the following HTML/CSS features:
- A background color for the entire page of your choosing.
- A div containing:
  - [ ] an H1 Element with an ID of 'Title'.
  - [ ] Image element related to the media with and ID of 'CoverArt' (Cover art is good here). This image should be circular/have rounded edges.
  - [ ] Heading 5 element with an ID of 'Rating'. This should be the rating from IMDB out of 10. 
  - [ ] Iframe embeding a youtube video of a trailer of the media with an ID of 'Trailer'. This can be acquired by right clicking on the video, and copying the embed.
  - [ ] Attribute linking to the IMDB page.
  - [ ] the summary text from IMDB in a Paragraph element with an ID of 'Summary'.
  - [ ] Unordered list of three to five actors. This unorder list element should have an ID of 'Actors'.
- All content on the page should be centered.
- Color all text on the page in a contrasting color to the one you picked for the background.

It is best to take this little pieces at a time, step by step, as not to get confused by too many things at once. [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) is an amazing resource, and has examples on everything above if you get stuck.
